# About Me  

## Code  

Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, Js/Javascript, and Google sheets scripting.  A much more expensive knowledge of markdown.  I am by no means a coder/programmer.  This is a hobby so don't expect my repo's to be maintained, unless it is something that is linked in this page directly, if it is not here, it means one of three things.  
1) I feel that the project will only be updated so far into the future that it is not worth considering as maintained.  
2) I have hit a stop in my skill and no longer know how to continue improving.  Though I suppose that is a good reason to keep repo's viewable.  
Or  
3) I have completely lost interest in the project or was something that I _was_ helping with and no longer am.  That said however, I am always more than happy to update and maintain if and when there is enough interest.
